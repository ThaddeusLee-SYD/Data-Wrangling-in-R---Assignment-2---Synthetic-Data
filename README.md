# Data-Wrangling-in-R---Assignment-2---Synthetic-Data

This is the second assignment for Data Wrangling and formed part of my Graduate Certificate in Data Science.

The goal of this assignment is creating and pre-processing synthetic data in R to create a 'Believable' data set for UBER. One data set is created for riders, the second is for drivers, these data sets are then merged are then merged to allow for more transformations and calculations to take place.

The report attached includes the code and all the processes for creating different types of data including: nominal, categorical, date time, and numeric.
As well as documenting how the data was transformed to create new columns from existing columns.
